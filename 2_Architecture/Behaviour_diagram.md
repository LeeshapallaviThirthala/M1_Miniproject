# Behavioural diagram
* UML Behavioral Diagrams depict the elements of a system that are dependent on time and that convey the dynamic concepts of the system and how they relate to each other. The elements in these diagrams resemble the verbs in a natural language and the relationships that connect them typically convey the passage of time.
# Flowchart
* Activity diagram is another important diagram in UML to describe the dynamic aspects of the system. Activity diagram is basically a flowchart to represent the flow from one activity to another activity.
